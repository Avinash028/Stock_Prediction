# Stock_Prediction

The idea at the base of this project is to build a model to predict financial market’s movements. The forecasting algorithm aims to foresee whether tomorrow’s  exchange closing price is going to be lower or higher with respect to today. Stock price prediction is one of the most widely studied and challenging problems, attracting researchers from many ﬁelds including economics, history, ﬁnance, mathematics, and computer science. The volatile nature of the stock market makes it difﬁcult to apply simple time-series or regression techniques. Financial institutions and traders have created various proprietary models to try and beat the market for themselves or their clients, but rarely has anyone achieved consistently higher-than-average returns on investment. Nevertheless, the challenge of stock forecasting is so appealing because an improvement of just a few percentage points can increase proﬁt by millions of dollars for these institutions.
Our goal is to use SVM at time t to predict whether a given stock’s price is higher or lower on day t+m.
